# Wine-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression


This project looks into classifying low and high quality wines using physicochemical measurements.


Logistic regression and LDA methods are compared and model selection is done on the measurements. Diagnostics are performed.


An 86.2% accuracy is achieved on the test set which suggests that a relatively simple logistic regression can classify between high and low quality wines once the appropriate variables are selected.
